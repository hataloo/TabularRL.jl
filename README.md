## ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§ 

An experimental library implementing many classical reinforcement learning algorithms such as Q-learning, temporal difference learning, value iteration and policy iteration.

The library has a general struct called TabularMDP to define an MDP with a discrete state and action space. Several MDPs from Sutton & Barto have been implemented such as HallwayMDP, CliffWalking and JacksCarRental. There exist helpful functions to define arbitrary GridWorld-like MDPs, see FrozenLake.

Finally, I am in the process of creating visualizations of MDPs that can be interacted with. Currently, only HallwayMDP has a visualization. See the example below:
